        I am Albert Dugba, a passionate web developer with nearly 4 years of
        experience. I specialize in creating exceptional online experiences for
        a diverse range of industries, including web3, social, education, and
        health. My journey into web development began in 2016 during my time in
        university, where I was introduced to Adobe Dreamweaver and became
        captivated by the power and beauty of website creation. Throughout my
        career, I have successfully delivered a wide range of projects, from
        simple marketing websites to complex solutions. Known for my
        adaptability and quick mastery of new technologies and processes, I
        thrive in fast-paced startup environments.
